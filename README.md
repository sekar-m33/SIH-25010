## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
<p>The solution is a multi-layered system consisting of a mobile app and a web dashboard that allows users to report accidents instantly and get emergency help. GPS and location tracking ensure victims get connected to nearby hospitals, ambulances, and police stations. AI/ML algorithms predict accident-prone zones by analyzing road patterns, traffic flow, and weather data. IoT sensors in vehicles and roads monitor conditions in real time, while awareness campaigns and gamified safety modules promote responsible driving.
The solution combines technology + community participation to build a sustainable road safety ecosystem.</p>

## Technical Approach
<p>Technically, the project is built on modern tools and frameworks for scalability and efficiency. The mobile app is developed using React Native, while the web interface uses ReactJS. Backend services are handled by Node.js and Express, ensuring fast data processing. PostgreSQL and MongoDB provide reliable storage for structured and unstructured data. AI/ML models, trained in Python with TensorFlow and scikit-learn, analyze historical and live data for predictions. IoT integration uses Raspberry Pi/Arduino sensors to detect collisions or hazardous conditions, and cloud hosting on AWS/Azure ensures reliability, security, and nationwide access.The architecture is modular, meaning new features (like traffic violation detection or insurance claim integration) can be added later.</p>

## Feasibility and Viability
<p>Economically, the solution is low-cost as it uses open-source tools and scalable cloud storage. Technically, it leverages widely available technologies like AI, IoT, and mobile apps, making it easy to implement. Socially, it can save countless lives, reduce accident-related healthcare costs, and promote safer road culture. The project is viable through partnerships with government bodies, NGOs, and private hospitals, and it can be gradually expanded from one city to nationwide implementation.The system could also attract corporate CSR funding as road safety is a critical public concern.</p>

## Impact and Benefits
<p>In the short term, the project improves emergency response times, enabling quicker medical assistance and saving lives. In the long run, it builds accident databases, identifies black spots, and assists policymakers with data-driven solutions. It improves road culture by spreading awareness, reducing reckless driving, and promoting responsible behavior. For the government, it provides better monitoring of road conditions, while society benefits from fewer accidents, reduced costs, and safer transportation.Insurance companies can also benefit by using the system for accurate claim assessments.</p>
